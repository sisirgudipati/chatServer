For the multi-room chat server, I implemented it so that duplicate usernames couldn't exist, and duplicate room names can't exist. Each person can create a private
password protected room which requires every person who wants to enter it to type in a password. For my creative portion, I did three things: first, I implemented a
quick reply feature, which has preset buttons that can be clicked on to send a message; second, I implemented a destroy room function, that allows only the creator of a room (if he is currently in the room) to delete the room and send all users back to the lobby; third, for the private messages to users within a room, I prompted the user to input a color (all lowercase and no space/extra words) that would color the message when appended to the chat log.
